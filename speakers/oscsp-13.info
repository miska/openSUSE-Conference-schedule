Dirk has worked for SUSE since 2005, and has been involved in openSUSE distribution development
since the beginning. He started to work on the ARM port in 2011 as part of the SUSE hackweek.  From
his experience with the openSUSE Build Service and with packaging hundreds of packages in the
openSUSE distribution, maintaining the rpmlint checks and other build checks in Factory, he knows
quite a few tricks which helped the ARM porting team in finishing the project quickly.
