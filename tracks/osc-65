This session will show how to quickly and easily build customized Linux
images with SUSE Studio. These images are targeted but not limited to
cloud (SUSE Cloud, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure) and data center (VMware,
Xen, KVM, bare-metal) deployments. You can do it all from a single,
simple-to-use web configuration tool.
